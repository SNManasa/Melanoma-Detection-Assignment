# Melanoma Detection Assignment


### Problem Statement:
 To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


## Conclusions
The model was initially built and checked for Overfitting by observing the Training and Validation accuracy.
Using Dropout helped solved the overfitting problem 
Class rebalance helps in augmentation and achieving the best Training and validation accuracy.
